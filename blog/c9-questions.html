      <p><h2> Bad Questions? </h2></p>
        <p>Being a teacher, I feel a little contradictory saying that there are such things as <i>bad questions</i>. So instead of emphasizing on what a not so great question looks like, I'll outline some attributes that <b>great</b> questions include!</p>

      <p><h2> Good Questions: </h2></p>
      <p>Some helpful guidelines to formulate a good question: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Make the title count! The title should be:
          <ul>
            <li>Specific</li>
            <li>Concise</li>
            <li>Interesting</li>
            <li>Captivating </li>
          </ul>
          The general rule of thumb here is, pretend like you're asking someone who is really really busy </li>

          <li>Make sure there are no spelling errors! We all like to make fun of <i> that guy/girl </i> who can't even spell the question correctly and then think to ourselves <i>"sweetheart you've got a lot bigger problems than this question" </i> </li>

          <li>Don't include <b>ALL </b> of your code- no one wants to dig through it to find your question. In fact, include as little code as possible, and even then- be careful of posting your employers code on public forums </li>

          <li>The general rule of thumb to all things in life: <b>KISS</b> <u>K</u>eep <u>I</u>t <u>S</u>imple <u>S</u>tupid. If someone is going out of their way to help you answer a question, make their life as easy as possible!</li>

          <li>Respond to comments! Make sure people know your appreciate their help</li>

          <li>ALWAYS proofread your question and try to answer it yourself with a fresh set of eyes after drafting your post. </li>

          </ol>

          <p>Happy Questioning!</p>
