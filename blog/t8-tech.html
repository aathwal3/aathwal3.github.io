  <h2>SQL Query Optimization</h2>
  <h4>August 9, 2015</h4>
</header>

  <section>
    <p>SQL statements are used to retrieve data from databases. To optimize/tune the process of retrieving data, we must consider performance. There are many different statements that can be written to retrieve the same data, and in order to optimize or tune to performance of retrieval, there are some different queries we can choose to us.
    </p>

    <p>
    Below is a list of ten dos and don'ts in order to optimize your SQL performance: 
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>SELECT actual column names instead of using the * function
        <pre class = "example"><b>ie.</b>    
        SELECT column_name 
        FROM title_name   

          <i>instead of </i> 

        SELECT * 
        FROM title_name</pre></li>
      <li>Use <span class= "example">HAVING</span> as a clause to filter selected data 
      <pre class= "example"><b>ie.</b>    SELECT column_name  
      FROM title_name 
      HAVING specific_attributes </pre></li>
      <li>Try to minimize the amount of sub query within in the query</li>
      <li>Be careful using the operators <span class= "example">EXIST, IN and table joins </span> correctly 
        <ul>
          <li><span class= "example">IN</span> is one of the slowest operators- so avoid using it</li>
          <li><span class= "example">IN</span> is most appropriate when most of the information is held within the subquery</li>
          <li><span class= "example">EXISTS</span> is most appropriate when most of the information is held in the query</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>In tables that have one-to-many relationships, use EXIST instead of DISTINCT </li>
      <li>Use <span class= "example">UNION ALL</span> instead of <span class= "example"> UNION</span> </li>
      <li>Be careful using the <span class= "example"> WHERE </span>clause, and try to make <span class= "example"> WHERE </span>statements less specific so it has less to process</li>
      <li>Use <span class= "example">DECODE </span> to avoid repetitively scanning the same rows </li>
      <li>Avoid storing large binary objects directly into the database, instead create a separate file and store the file path to minimize processing </li>
      <li>Syntax Rules: 
        <ul> 
          <li>Single space all SQL verbs </li>
          <li>Single case for all SQL verbs </li>
          <li>Being all SQL verbs on a new line (unlike my examples above)</li>
          <li>Align SQL verbs left or right all starting with the verb </li>
        </ul>
      </li>


    </ol>
    <p>These ten basic rules, courtesy of http://beginner-sql-tutorial.com/sql-query-tuning.htm will help optimize and tune your SQL so that the data can be retrieved and processed most efficiently.
