      After taking the Gregoric Thinking Style quiz, I have identified that I am a <b>Concrete Sequential </b> thinking style. Attributes of someone with this thinking style include: 
      <b>Likes</b>
        <ul> 
          <li>Order </li>
          <li>Logical sequence </li>
          <li>Following directions, predictability</li>
          <li>Getting facts </li>
        </ul>

        <b> They learn best when:</b>
        <ul>
         <li>They have a structured environment </li>
         <li>They can rely on others to complete this task </li>
         <li>Are faced with predictable situations</li>
         <li>Can apply ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
        </ul>

        <b>What's hard for them?</b>
        <ul>         
          <li>Working in groups</li>
          <li>Discussions that seem to have no specific point</li>
          <li>Working in an unorganized environment</li>
          <li>Following incomplete or unclear directions</li>
          <li>Working with unpredictable people</li>
          <li>Dealing with abstract ideas</li>
          <li>Demands to "use your imagination"</li>
          <li>Questions with no right or wrong answers</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    I completely agree with the description of my thinking style. I am very much grounded in reality and work best in a clean and structured environment. 
    With that being said, my biggest challenges come from my inability to be creative and think outside of the box. I had struggles with designing my website because I couldn't think of ways to make it prettier or how to design it. I know a lot of my inability to think outside of the box and be creative has been a result of a fixed mindset. I'm perpetuating the cycle of my inability to imagine by constantly closing myself out and shutting myself down whenever the opportunity to be creative prevails. The Growth vs. Fixed mindset reading illuminated the importance of me being open to trying new things and allowing myself to dabble into being creative and accept my failures as opportunities for growth.
