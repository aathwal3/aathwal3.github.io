      In my first week of Dev Bootcamp Phase 0, I have learned an extensive amount of content. Although the curriculum is dauntingly overwhelming so far, and my fingers are sore in ways they've never been before (especially my middle finger from having to back space so much) I am thoroughly enjoying the excitement from embarking on this new challenge that's provoking me to think in ways I have not before.
    </p>
    A few of the biggest things that I have learned this week are what version control is, why Git is so great for it, and why we're using GitHub to store our code. Version control is basically a safe way to have every draft of my work saved. This gives me the ability to revert back to any prior drafts or versions of my code that may have worked in a more optimal way than my current code. Git does a wonderful just of allowing different users to collaborate on code through the use of branches and tracking changes and edits made by each user through a streaming process. This too saves each edited version of the changed code so that users collaborating don't overlap or step on each otherâ€™s toes. Git is used locally on each computer, and GitHub is a global sharing tool where users can collaborate and store code remotely online and access and share with other users.

    That's my first blog in a nutshell! Very Excited to keep working, learning, and growing as a coder!
