  <h2>How I Feel About Embarking On This Journey</h2>

    I am so incredibly excited to start my journey of becoming a software engineer. I absolutely love the Dev Bootcamp learning culture and cohesiveness of treating each student as a whole person, as demonstrate through the engineering empathy curriculum. I am nervous about learning so much content so quickly and being able to keep pace with my cohort, but I'm also enthused and ready to be challenged.

    I have spent my last two years working for Teach For America as a high school chemistry teacher in South Central Los Angeles. Throughout this time I have faced a lot of backlash against the Teach For America organization from critics. During this time, I have embodied that TFA is not a separate entity from the individuals who serve as teachers. I feel like Dev Bootcamp has starklingly similar charactersticts. Dev Bootcamp would not exist without its students, and any criticism of the program is criticism of the people who are learning and developing as engineers. I love this mindset and can't wait to continue to have pride in my work.
